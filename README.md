# APAN25
Second year project for Applied Political Analytics (APAN) Master's Program for University of Maryland, College Park


The Master of Science Degree in Applied Political Analytics is offered jointly by the Department of Government & Politics and the Joint Program in Survey Methodology. The program provides advanced training in applying data science to the analysis of critical issues in political science. APAN exists to train future employees of many political organizations seeking to stay on the cutting edge of political data analysis. We do this by providing students with a firm foundation of the principles and theories of political science alongside practical applications of sound research designs, coding, database management, and data visualization. This is a non-thesis program, though students will also complete a significant independent project in one of their courses in their final year.
